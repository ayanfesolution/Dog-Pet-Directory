# SQ010-iOS-Week-Six-Task

## Objective 

 

Your task is to implement a pet directory app and get it looking as close to the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/CWAmKsoR84bWgN9wvS4O9e/Pet-Directory?node-id=0%3A1) as possible. 

 

## Brief 

 

We have provided you with this [design](https://www.figma.com/file/CWAmKsoR84bWgN9wvS4O9e/Pet-Directory?node-id=0%3A1) for the app. You are to build the app ensuring your code is clean and readable with a minimum of 3 unit tests. 

  

## Tasks 

Fetch and display a list of cats/dogs (pets) from https://thecatapi.com/ or https://thedogapi.com/ 

Users can "favourite" (fave) pets. 

Faved pets are cached locally (using user defaults) and displayed on another list as shown in the design. 

Write tests for your business logic, bonus points for testing other layers such as the networking layer.
